Explore the transient beauty of nature through the lens of our cameras. Ephemeral Landscapes is an exhibition that captures the essence of fleeting moments in the natural world. From sunrise over misty mountains to the dance of leaves in the wind, each photograph tells a story of impermanence and the beauty found in the passing of time.
